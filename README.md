# Urban Jungle Juggle

As urban jungles continue to trend, people will continue to collect rarer and more unique plants in their collections. UJJ will keep a database for all their plants with their own individual care needs.

Users will be able to add, update, and remove plants from their database as their urban jungle evolves.

## Planning Story
This app began with simple sketches and a short list of user features.

After the major features of the database have been established, there is room for further development and expansions.

 ## User Stories
* As a user I'll be able to add new plants to my database.
* As a user I'll be able to edit the plant profile and care instructions
* As a user I'll be able to see all plants in my database.
* As a user I'll be able to delete plants from my database.
* As a user I'll be able to view detailed information about one plant.

## Technologies Used
* MongoDb
* Mongoose
* Javascript
* Express
* Node

## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans
* Future versions will allow for care comments to be logged for the duration of the life of the plant
* Future versions will allow for more detailed views of the plant
* Future versions will allow for uploading and displaying images.
